# Coven

**What it is.** A .NET engine for orchestrating multiple AI coding agents (‚ÄúMagikBlocks‚Äù) that collaborate in a shared context, with routing decided at runtime by tags/capabilities. It builds on Codex CLI‚Äôs sandboxing and tooling and currently targets single‚Äëmachine use.

**Core ideas.**

* **MagikBlock**: typed unit of work; compose into graphs with **MagikBuilder**; configuration becomes immutable at `.Done()`.
* **Tagging & capabilities** drive selection. Routes to the node with the most matching tags, uses registration order as tie breaker.
* **Board**: runtime that posts/consumes work; supports Push (recommended) and Pull modes with timeout/retry control.

# Quick start
Magikblocks scale from tiny applications like below to sprawling multi-agent workflows.

## Build a pipeline and run it

Here‚Äôs a minimal ritual that takes a string, reverses the words, and rejoins them.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Coven.Core;
using Coven.Core.Builder;

public sealed class SplitWords : IMagikBlock<string, string[]>
{
    public Task<string[]> DoMagik(string input) =>
        Task.FromResult(input.Split(' ', StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries));
}

public sealed class ReverseWords : IMagikBlock<string[], string[]>
{
    public Task<string[]> DoMagik(string[] words) =>
        Task.FromResult(words.Reverse().ToArray());
}

public sealed class JoinWords : IMagikBlock<string[], string>
{
    public Task<string> DoMagik(string[] words) =>
        Task.FromResult(string.Join(" ", words) + " üåû");
}

public class App
{
    public static async Task Main()
    {
        var coven = new MagikBuilder<string, string>()
            .MagikBlock(new SplitWords())
            .MagikBlock(new ReverseWords())
            .MagikBlock(new JoinWords())
            .Done();

        var input = "incandescent grossly so be could I only If";
        var result = await coven.Ritual<string, string>(input);

        Console.WriteLine(result);
        // Output: If only I could be so grossly incandescent üåû
    }
}
```
