# Commercial Terms (Invitation to Negotiate — Not a License)

Commercial rights to Coven are available only under a separate written agreement executed by Licensor and the specific organization seeking such rights. This document is an invitation to negotiate, not an offer, and grants no rights.

Typical deal knobs (for guidance only):
- Scope/Metrics: Instances, cores, MAUs, business units, geographic regions.
- Term: Subscription (e.g., 12 months) or multi‑year.
- Affiliates: Which legal entities are covered.
- Support/SLA: Standard or premium; response/restore times.
- Fees & Payment: Annual or quarterly; taxes borne by customer (except Licensor’s income taxes).
- Run‑off or Integrated‑Product Survival: Optional post‑term grace limited to existing deployments.
