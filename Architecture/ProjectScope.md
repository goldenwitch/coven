# Project Scope

- Run on one box. A distributed version of this might be offered in the future, but for now just make calls out to the network in a MagikBlock if you need to do remote stuff.
- A minimal set of samples that satisfy the needs of the selfish developer writing these docs while reluctantly avoiding avoiding work.
- A library of extensions to the core orchestration engine that makes it easy to orchestrate AI Agents.
- Initially, just dotnet. Something something something money something something something typescript.
