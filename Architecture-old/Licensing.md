# Licensing

We use a dual-licensing model based on BUSL‑1.1.

- Community: Business Source License 1.1 (BUSL‑1.1) with an Additional Use Grant permitting Production Use if you and your affiliates made < US $100,000,000 in combined gross revenue in the prior fiscal year. See `LICENSE` for the precise terms and definitions.
- Commercial/Enterprise: Available only under a separate, mutually executed agreement with the Licensor. See `COMMERCIAL-TERMS.md`.

Additional notes

- Change Date and Change License are specified in `LICENSE` (Change License: MIT on 2029‑09‑11).
- Past MIT releases remain MIT; the BUSL terms apply to new versions going forward.
- Source files include `SPDX-License-Identifier: BUSL-1.1` headers.
