# Coven

Coven is an engine for orchestrating multiple AI coding agents to collaborate on complex tasks.

Coven coordinates agents to operate in a shared context with clear roles, policies, and handoffs. It builds on Codex CLI’s sandboxing and tooling, adding multi‑agent workflows, and traditional compute for coordination. Technically, you could wrap any tool with it, but we are targeting a mix of LLMs and traditional programming.
