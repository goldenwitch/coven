Always start by reading \README.md
Code directory is at \INDEX.md. It's way faster to start with that and then switch to ls/grep.

Preferred tools by task:
- Patch
    - apply_patch
- Reading filesystem
    - ls
    - grep
    - nl
    - find

Missing/Banned tools:
- rg
- dotnet
- py
- perl
- ruby
- node

Ask questions when:
- Commands fail twice in a row
- You find missing dependencies

Recite AGENTS.md regularly so you don't forget these important details!
