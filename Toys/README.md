Small, focused console apps that each demonstrate a single Coven feature in isolation. These are intentionally minimal so you can test one concept at a time.

- ConsoleEcho: Wires the console chat adapter to echo back whatever you type.

How to run (from repo root): open the individual project folder in your IDE or run it with your preferred tooling.

VS Code: Run/Debug

- In Run and Debug, select `.NET Launch (Console) - ConsoleEcho`.
- Interact via the Terminal panel (not Debug Console). Use the terminal tab with the same name as the launch config to type messages.
- Prefer a separate console window? Change `console` to `externalTerminal` for the ConsoleEcho configuration in `.vscode/launch.json`.
