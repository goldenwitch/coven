# Coding

- Delete unused code. If a feature isn't used by any toys or samples, delete it and delegate an agent to write a proposal in `proposals/feature-name.md` describing what the feature should have been.
- Prefer clean deletion over commenting out. Version control is the archive.
- Match existing patterns. Consistency over preference.
